# calculator-v2

Build a calculator

create four functions for add, subtract, multiply, divide
each does the expected thing
create a function that expects one of them along with two Ints
in other words, a generic "math operation" function
it should then take the two Ints and pass them to the function
and return the result
Array fun

create two new functions for add/mul
instead of taking two Ints, take an array of Ints instead
return the result of (adding/multiplying) all of the elements
create two new functions (count, avg) that take an array of Ints
again, operate on the array and return the result
return the result
refactor all four down to another "generic math operation" approach
like in the previous part
Points

use tuples to represent x/y point pairs
create two functions for adding and subtracting points
(1,2) + (3,4) = (4,6)
(1,2) - (3,4) = (-2,-2)
now use Dictionaries to represent points
"x" is the x coordinate, "y" is the y coordinate
create two functions for adding and subtracting points
(1,2) + (3,4) = (4,6)
(1,2) - (3,4) = (-2,-2)
handle dictionaries without "x" or "y" without crashing
handle dictionaries with Double values without crashing
 Extra Credit

rewritten with optionals
